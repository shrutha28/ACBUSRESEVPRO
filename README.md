# ACBUSRESEVPRO
ABSTRACT:  
 The main aim behind the mini project is to allot seats in the ac bus of SVCE.
This is an impartial way of allocation of seats based on first come first serve criteria.


PLANNING:


The back behind this project is the use of login activity which assures a valid student of SVCE . The application proceeds with   the candidate  checking his bus schedule entering  his route number .On activation   of “proceed” button  the application moves on with displaying the layout  of the  bus. The student is allowed to  select the  required seat .  Upon successful completion of all above the pages the app directs the valid student into a page that displays the entire ticket.


WORKING:


The app is basically designed with android studios with java based code.
Initially the app starts working with a main activity which is a basic login page that takes the user name and password as the basic login info. Upon successful completion of the login details the app directs you in to a bus schedule link page that helps the students to check the bus schedule to find out the availability of the bus on that day. The next page has the bus info entry page that takes route number as the   input and directs the user into the bus view  page .
The bus internal view page has a layout of the entire bus that provides layout of the bus .The user has the privilege to choose the   seat. The seat has the specification whether the seat is a normal seat or a window seat.
The user upon successful selection of the seat will be confirmed that the seat has been   selected successfully. 
The next page takes the user in to the bus ticket page where the student name and few other details are displayed. The route no and the date must be manually entered. The amount to be paid will be specified and the student will be asked to take a Screenshot. 
The next page will be moved on upon successful booking and student can exit from the app.
